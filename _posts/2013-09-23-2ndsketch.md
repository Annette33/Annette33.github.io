When we were given the assignment to draw a rabbit character that tells a story, I didn't think of 'Alice in Wonderland', but I thought of the book/animation 'Watership Down'. I was thinking about intro folk tale about El-ahrairah and how everything became his enemy. So I wanted to go with a theme that the rabbit had the world versus himself. Then I remember the anime 'Cat Shit One' and how the rabbits were outfitted in military gear. So my drawing is a combination of both of these influences.
