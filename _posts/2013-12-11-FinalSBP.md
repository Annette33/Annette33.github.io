Here is a link to my final project [here](http://vimeo.com/81562998) made with a combination of Photoshop, After Effects, and Premiere Pro. It's funny as this story all came from my friend and I walking through a park and finding a very friendly stray cat, lol! If you want to see more drawings, head over to [http://akairyuu91.deviantart.com/](http://akairyuu91.deviantart.com/). For some other animations of mine, please go to www.annettewooley.virb.com. This will be changing over to GitHub over the next couple of months.
