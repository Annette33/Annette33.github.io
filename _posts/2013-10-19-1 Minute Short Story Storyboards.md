Here are some rough colored drawings of my storyboards for my 1 minute story. I tried to base the colors off of an anime called 'K', but it didn't turn out too well. I wanted to have happy and cheerful colors so that it would give the audience a false sense of security. I particularly like the las couple of panels. I'll be adding more panels later this week.
