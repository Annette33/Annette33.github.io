Our group of two decided to draw a larger version of a panel that I had drawn while listening to 'The Little Prince'. This scene shows how the man crash landed in the middle of a vast desert with nothing other than seas of sand. I wanted to convey how alone, abandoned, and completely unprepared the man was feeling.
