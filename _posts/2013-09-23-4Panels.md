Doing the four panels was a little difficult since I had to choose only 4 scenes to draw. I settled on when Jack went into the baby's room almost stabbed a teddy bear that he thought was the baby. Next, I wanted to convey the confusion of whether or not the mother was dead by drawing an image of her laying on the bed, but with the back of her head facing the audience. I wanted to leave the audience with the same question I had when I first hear the story. The third panel is when Mr. and Mrs. Owens discover the baby in the graveyard and are trying to decide what to do. I purposely didn't show the legs because I wanted the audience to think that they are regular people, eventhough they were dressed a little differently. Finally, I wanted to show the audience that Mr. and Mrs. Owens were ghosts by having the baby lay his head on her lap that was faded, meaning she is a ghost.
