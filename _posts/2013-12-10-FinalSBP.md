Here is a link to my final project made with a combination of Photoshop, After Effects, and Premiere Pro (http://vimeo.com/81562998). It's funny as this story all came from my friend and I walking through a park and finding a very friendly stray cat, lol! If you want to see more drawings, head over to http://akairyuu91.deviantart.com/. For some other animations of mine, please go to www.annettewooley.virb.com.
