These are the storyboards I drew for the Dr. Who episode. I wanted to concentrate on the scene where Vincent starts to crack and demands that the Dr. and Amy leave his home. I noticed that anytime the camera was on Vincent, the colors were dark, shadowy, and very plain. But when the camera was on either Amy or the Dr., they were bright and cheery. So I tried to convey that with my choice of colors.
